Instagram's rapid growth from 0 to 14 million users in just over a year with only three engineers was achieved by following key principles and building a reliable tech stack. Here's how they accomplished it:

**Guiding Principles:**
1. **Keep things very simple:** Instagram focused on simplicity in both design and engineering. This allowed them to build and scale their platform efficiently.

2. **Don't re-invent the wheel:** Instead of building custom solutions for every problem, Instagram leveraged existing technologies and services to speed up development.

3. **Use proven, solid technologies when possible:** Instagram relied on established and reliable technologies to ensure stability.

**Tech Stack Explained:**

**OS/Hosting:**
- Instagram ran on Ubuntu Linux 11.04 on Amazon EC2, using Elastic Compute Cloud for hosting. This choice provided scalability.

**Load Balancing:**
- Initially, they used DNS Round-Robin between two Nginx machines, but later switched to Amazon's Elastic Load Balancer for improved load balancing.

**Frontend:**
- Instagram was initially an iOS app, likely written in Objective-C and using UIKit for the interface.

**Backend:**
- Instagram's application server used Django and was written in Python. Gunicorn served as their WSGI server.

**General Data Storage:**
- Most of Instagram's data, including users and photo metadata, was stored in PostgreSQL. Instagram sharded their data to handle the high volume of data they received.

**Photo Storage:**
- Several terabytes of photos were stored in Amazon S3, and Amazon CloudFront was used as a CDN to serve photos quickly to users.

**Caching:**
- Instagram used Redis for various caching purposes. Redis was stored in-memory and sharded across multiple machines.

**Master-Replica Setup:**
- Both PostgreSQL and Redis ran in master-replica setups and used Amazon EBS snapshotting to take frequent backups.

**Push Notifications and Async Tasks:**
- Push notifications were sent using pyapns. Instagram used Gearman for asynchronous tasks, with approximately 200 Python workers.

**Monitoring:**
- Instagram used a combination of tools for monitoring, including Munin for graphing system-wide metrics and alerting for anomalies, Sentry for Python error reporting, Pingdom for external service monitoring, and PagerDuty for handling incidents and notifications.

The architecture evolved as Instagram's user base grew, and they adopted solutions that aligned with their guiding principles of simplicity and reliability. Their tech stack was carefully selected to handle their workload while minimizing complexity and reinventing existing technologies.

The key takeaway is that with the right principles and a well-chosen tech stack, it's possible to scale a platform quickly and efficiently, even with a small engineering team.
