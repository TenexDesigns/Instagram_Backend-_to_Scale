Yes, you can still learn to develop scalable applications locally on your machine. You can use a variety of free and open source tools and technologies to get started.

Here are some tips for developing scalable applications locally:

* **Use a virtual machine:** A virtual machine (VM) allows you to create a simulated computer environment on your machine. This can be useful for testing and developing scalable applications because you can create multiple VMs and configure each one to represent a different environment, such as a production environment, a staging environment, and a development environment.
* **Use a lightweight database:** A lightweight database, such as SQLite or PostgreSQL, can be a good choice for developing scalable applications locally because it does not require a lot of resources.
* **Use a lightweight web server:** A lightweight web server, such as Nginx or Unicorn, can be a good choice for developing scalable applications locally because it does not require a lot of resources.
* **Use a caching server:** A caching server, such as Redis or Memcached, can be used to improve the performance of your application by storing frequently accessed data in memory.
* **Use a queuing system:** A queuing system, such as Gearman or RabbitMQ, can be used to process asynchronous tasks, such as sending emails or generating reports.

Here are some examples of free and open source tools and technologies that you can use to develop scalable applications locally:

* **Virtual machines:** VirtualBox and VMware Workstation are two popular free and open source virtual machine software applications.
* **Databases:** SQLite and PostgreSQL are two popular free and open source database software applications.
* **Web servers:** Nginx and Unicorn are two popular free and open source web server software applications.
* **Caching servers:** Redis and Memcached are two popular free and open source caching server software applications.
* **Queuing systems:** Gearman and RabbitMQ are two popular free and open source queuing system software applications.

If you want to deploy your scalable application to the cloud, there are a number of free and low-cost options available. For example, Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a free tier that includes a variety of services, such as EC2, S3, and RDS. Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Microsoft Azure also offer free and low-cost options.

Here are some tips for deploying your scalable application to the cloud:

* **Choose the right cloud provider:** There are a number of cloud providers to choose from, such as AWS, GCP, and Azure. Each provider has its own strengths and weaknesses, so it is important to choose the one that is right for your needs.
* **Start with a small instance:** You can start with a small instance and then scale up as needed. This will help you to keep your costs down.
* **Use a load balancer:** A load balancer will distribute traffic across multiple servers, which can improve performance and reliability.
* **Use a caching server:** A caching server can store frequently accessed data in memory, which can improve the performance of your application.
* **Use a database sharding:** Database sharding is a technique that divides your database into multiple smaller databases. This can improve scalability and performance by reducing the load on any single database server.

By following these tips, you can develop and deploy scalable applications locally and in the cloud.
