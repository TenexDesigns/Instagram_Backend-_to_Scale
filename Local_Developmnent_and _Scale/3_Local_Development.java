Yes, you can still learn to develop scalable Rails applications locally on your machine, even without the operational cost to run all of the technologies mentioned above in a cloud like AWS.

Here is a basic tech stack that you can use to run Rails applications locally:

* **Ruby:** The Ruby programming language.
* **Rails:** The Ruby on Rails framework.
* **PostgreSQL:** A relational database management system (RDBMS).
* **Redis:** An in-memory data store.
* **Memcached:** Another in-memory data store.
* **Sidekiq:** A Ruby job queue.

You can install all of these technologies on your local machine using a package manager such as Homebrew or apt-get.

Once you have installed all of the required technologies, you can start developing your Rails application. You can use the following command to create a new Rails application:

```
rails new my_app
```

Once the new application has been created, you can start developing it by creating controllers, models, and views.

To run your Rails application locally, you can use the following command:

```
rails server
```

This will start a Rails development server on port 3000. You can then access your application in a web browser at http://localhost:3000.

As you develop your Rails application, you may need to use additional technologies, such as a load balancer and a database sharding solution. However, you can start by learning how to develop Rails applications locally without using these technologies.

Here are some cheap options or free options to deploy Rails applications to the cloud:

* **Heroku:** Heroku is a cloud platform that offers a free tier for Rails applications.
* **AWS Elastic Beanstalk:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk is a cloud platform that offers a free tier for Rails applications.
* **Google Cloud Platform App Engine:** Google Cloud Platform App Engine is a cloud platform that offers a free tier for Rails applications.

You can use any of these cloud platforms to deploy your Rails application for free. However, the free tiers have some limitations, such as limited resources and limited uptime.

As your application grows, you may need to upgrade to a paid tier on one of these cloud platforms. However, the paid tiers are still relatively affordable.

Overall, it is possible to learn to develop scalable Rails applications locally on your machine and to deploy them to the cloud at a low cost.
