Yes, you can replicate what Instagram did with Ruby on Rails. Ruby on Rails is a powerful framework that can be used to build scalable and reliable web applications. In fact, there are many popular social media platforms that are powered by Ruby on Rails, such as Twitter, Basecamp, and GitHub.

Here are some tips for scaling a Ruby on Rails social media platform to a large scale:

* **Use a reliable hosting provider:** Choose a hosting provider that has a good reputation and that can offer you the resources you need to scale your application.
* **Use a load balancer:** A load balancer will distribute traffic across multiple servers, which can help to improve performance and reliability.
* **Use a caching server:** A caching server can store frequently accessed data in memory, which can improve the performance of your application.
* **Use a database sharding:** Database sharding is a technique that divides your database into multiple smaller databases. This can improve scalability and performance by reducing the load on any single database server.
* **Use a queuing system:** A queuing system can help you to process asynchronous tasks, such as sending emails or generating reports. This can improve the performance of your application by freeing up your web servers to handle requests from users.

In addition to the above, you may also want to consider using some of the following technologies:

* **Redis:** Redis is an in-memory data store that can be used to cache frequently accessed data.
* **Memcached:** Memcached is another in-memory data store that can be used to cache frequently accessed data.
* **Gearman:** Gearman is a distributed work queue that can be used to process asynchronous tasks.
* **RabbitMQ:** RabbitMQ is another distributed work queue that can be used to process asynchronous tasks.
* **Sidekiq:** Sidekiq is a Ruby job queue that can be used to process asynchronous tasks.
* **Delayed Job:** Delayed Job is another Ruby job queue that can be used to process asynchronous tasks.

These technologies can help you to improve the performance and scalability of your Ruby on Rails social media platform.

Finally, it is important to monitor your application's performance and to make adjustments as needed. You can use tools such as New Relic and AppSignal to monitor your application's performance.

By following these tips, you can scale your Ruby on Rails social media platform to a large scale.
